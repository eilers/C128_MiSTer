/*
   Adjusted for the MEGA65 port (Vivado instead of Quartus):

   1. iecdrv_mem lost its "ram_init_file" attribute. It is Quartus-only and every
      call site that passed an INITFILE is commented out upstream.

   2. iecdrv_trackmem was an altsyncram instance, which Vivado cannot synthesize.
      It is now inferred block RAM using the same shape as iecdrv_mem above.
      Both take address, data and wren on one edge, the way altsyncram registers
      them: every caller strobes wren for a single cycle, so a pipeline stage that
      does not carry the data along stores the wrong byte. See CORE/sim/tb_iecdrv_mem.vhd.

   3. iecdrv_sync needs a set_false_path entry in CORE.xdc for every instantiation.
